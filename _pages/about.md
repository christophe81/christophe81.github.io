This site serves two purposes:

1. As you’ve guessed from the title, I am interested in all things cloud. Mostly I will be writing/posting about random interesting things I’ve found online or have automated around the house.
1. You’ll also find information supporting my professional career as a Distinguished Product Manager at [Cisco](cisco.com) focusing on [Duo Security’s](duo.com)] and all things identity with a strong passion for federation. If you are new to the identity space, specifically, SAML, then I recommend checking out this blog post: [The Beer Drinker’s Guide to SAML](https://duo.com/blog/the-beer-drinkers-guide-to-saml) as this site will include:
   1. The documentation will be focused on integrating Duo SSO, as an identity provider (IdP) with other service providers (SP). This will be detailed step by step directions to help you also configure such integrations! I may branch out from time to time to include integrating other IdPs, such as Okta, Ping One, etc with SPs; espcially as Passwordless authenticaiton methods become more and more popular.
   1. Things I find interesting in the identity world, especially around funding and acquisitions occuring within the space.
